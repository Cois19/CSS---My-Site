        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā) is a former member of the
          Survey Corps. He is the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived
          in Shiganshina District with his parents and adopted sister Mikasa
          Ackerman until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed
          his mother being eaten by a Titan. This event would lead to Eren's
          intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off
          the face of the Earth.

          <h3>Founding Titan</h3>
          <p class="founding-titan-description">
            With the power of the Founding Titan that Grisha Yeager stole from
            the Reiss family, Eren possesses the ability to control nearby
            Titans, causing them to relentlessly attack his chosen target.
            However, this ability can only be used while Eren is in contact with
            a Titan of royal blood.

          <h3>Attack Titan</h3>
          <p class="attack-titan-description">
            After the fall of Wall Maria, Grisha found Eren in a refugee camp
            and brought him into a nearby forest. After giving him the key to
            the basement, Grisha injected a struggling Eren with a serum, which
            transformed him into a 4 meter Pure Titan with short rugged hair and
            a skinny body. This Titan ate Grisha, giving Eren the powers of the
            Founding Titan and Attack Titan. Years later, during the first
            Battle of Trost, Eren was eaten alive by a Titan, and inside the
            stomach-like cavity saw other fellow recruits lying dead/dying, one
            wanting her mother before sinking in stomach acid. The sight
            combined with intense feelings of desperation and his drive to
            exterminate all Titans awoke his ability to transform into his Titan
            form for the first time.

          <h3>War Hammer Titan</h3>
          <p class="war-hammer-titan-description">
            Eren obtained the power of the War Hammer Titan during the Raid on
            Liberio by devouring the younger sister of Willy. He is capable of
            using the War Hammer's abilities to create defensive pikes and
            caltrops to hinder his enemies in combat. He is also capable of
            sealing a long tunnel with hardened Titan flesh to evade capture.
